<p>Welcome to our introduction to reinforcement learning! Here, we aim to acquaint you with</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>the language and notation used to discuss the subject,</p></li>

</ul>
<p>In a nutshell, RL is the study of agents and how they learn by trial and error. It formalizes the idea that rewarding or punishing an agent for its behavior makes it more likely to repeat or forego that behavior in the future.</p>

<p>The main characters of RL are the <strong>agent</strong> and the <strong>environment</strong>. The environment is the world that the agent lives in and interacts with. At every step of interaction, the agent sees a (possibly partial) observation of the state of the world, and then decides on an action to take. The environment changes when the agent acts on it, but may also change on its own.</p>
<p>The agent also perceives a <strong>reward</strong> signal from the environment, a number that tells it how good or bad the current world state is. The goal of the agent is to maximize its cumulative reward, called <strong>return</strong>. Reinforcement learning methods are ways that the agent can learn behaviors to achieve its goal.</p>
<p>To talk more specifically what RL does, we need to introduce additional terminology. We need to talk about</p>

<section id="states-and-observations">
<h3>States and Observations<a class="headerlink" href="#states-and-observations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>state</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> is a complete description of the state of the world. There is no information about the world which is hidden from the state. An <strong>observation</strong> <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(o\)</span> is a partial description of a state, which may omit information.</p>
<p>In deep RL, we almost always represent states and observations by a <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_coordinate_space">real-valued vector, matrix, or higher-order tensor</a>. For instance, a visual observation could be represented by the RGB matrix of its pixel values; the state of a robot might be represented by its joint angles and velocities.</p>
<p>When the agent is able to observe the complete state of the environment, we say that the environment is <strong>fully observed</strong>. When the agent can only see a partial observation, we say that the environment is <strong>partially observed</strong>.</p>
<div class="admonition-you-should-know admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">You Should Know</p>
<p>Reinforcement learning notation sometimes puts the symbol for state, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>, in places where it would be technically more appropriate to write the symbol for observation, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(o\)</span>. Specifically, this happens when talking about how the agent decides an action: we often signal in notation that the action is conditioned on the state, when in practice, the action is conditioned on the observation because the agent does not have access to the state.</p>
<p>In our guide, we’ll follow standard conventions for notation, but it should be clear from context which is meant. If something is unclear, though, please raise an issue! Our goal is to teach, not to confuse.</p>

<section id="action-spaces">
<h3>Action Spaces<a class="headerlink" href="#action-spaces" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Different environments allow different kinds of actions. The set of all valid actions in a given environment is often called the <strong>action space</strong>. Some environments, like Atari and Go, have <strong>discrete action spaces</strong>, where only a finite number of moves are available to the agent. Other environments, like where the agent controls a robot in a physical world, have <strong>continuous action spaces</strong>. In continuous spaces, actions are real-valued vectors.</p>
<p>This distinction has some quite-profound consequences for methods in deep RL. Some families of algorithms can only be directly applied in one case, and would have to be substantially reworked for the other.</p>
</section>
<section id="policies">
<h3>Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A <strong>policy</strong> is a rule used by an agent to decide what actions to take. It can be deterministic, in which case it is usually denoted by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[a_t = \mu(s_t),\]</div>
<p>or it may be stochastic, in which case it is usually denoted by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[a_t \sim \pi(\cdot | s_t).\]</div>
<p>Because the policy is essentially the agent’s brain, it’s not uncommon to substitute the word “policy” for “agent”, eg saying “The policy is trying to maximize reward.”</p>
<p>In deep RL, we deal with <strong>parameterized policies</strong>: policies whose outputs are computable functions that depend on a set of parameters (eg the weights and biases of a neural network) which we can adjust to change the behavior via some optimization algorithm.</p>
<p>We often denote the parameters of such a policy by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\theta\)</span> or <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\phi\)</span>, and then write this as a subscript on the policy symbol to highlight the connection:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\begin{split}a_t &amp;= \mu_{\theta}(s_t) \\
a_t &amp;\sim \pi_{\theta}(\cdot | s_t).\end{split}\]</div>

<h4>Deterministic Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#deterministic-policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p><strong>Example: Deterministic Policies.</strong> Here is a code snippet for building a simple deterministic policy for a continuous action space in PyTorch, using the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">torch.nn</span></code> package:</p>

<p>This builds a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network with two hidden layers of size 64 and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tanh\)</span> activation functions.

<section id="stochastic-policies">
<h4>Stochastic Policies<a class="headerlink" href="#stochastic-policies" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The two most common kinds of stochastic policies in deep RL are <strong>categorical policies</strong> and <strong>diagonal Gaussian policies</strong>.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_distribution">Categorical</a> policies can be used in discrete action spaces, while diagonal <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution">Gaussian</a> policies are used in continuous action spaces.</p>
<p>Two key computations are centrally important for using and training stochastic policies:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>sampling actions from the policy,</p></li>
<li><p>and computing log likelihoods of particular actions, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log \pi_{\theta}(a|s)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>In what follows, we’ll describe how to do these for both categorical and diagonal Gaussian policies.</p>
<div class="admonition-categorical-policies admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Categorical Policies</p>
<p>A categorical policy is like a classifier over discrete actions. You build the neural network for a categorical policy the same way you would for a classifier: the input is the observation, followed by some number of layers (possibly convolutional or densely-connected, depending on the kind of input), and then you have one final linear layer that gives you logits for each action, followed by a <a class="reference external" href="https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/multi-class-neural-networks/softmax">softmax</a> to convert the logits into probabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Sampling.</strong> Given the probabilities for each action, frameworks like PyTorch and Tensorflow have built-in tools for sampling. For example, see the documentation for <a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html#categorical">Categorical distributions in PyTorch</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.multinomial">torch.multinomial</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/distributions/Categorical">tf.distributions.Categorical</a>, or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/random/multinomial">tf.multinomial</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Log-Likelihood.</strong> Denote the last layer of probabilities as <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{\theta}(s)\)</span>. It is a vector with however many entries as there are actions, so we can treat the actions as indices for the vector. The log likelihood for an action <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> can then be obtained by indexing into the vector:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\log \pi_{\theta}(a|s) = \log \left[P_{\theta}(s)\right]_a.\]</div>
</div>
<div class="admonition-diagonal-gaussian-policies admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">Diagonal Gaussian Policies</p>
<p>A multivariate Gaussian distribution (or multivariate normal distribution, if you prefer) is described by a mean vector, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu\)</span>, and a covariance matrix, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\Sigma\)</span>. A diagonal Gaussian distribution is a special case where the covariance matrix only has entries on the diagonal. As a result, we can represent it by a vector.</p>
<p>A diagonal Gaussian policy always has a neural network that maps from observations to mean actions, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu_{\theta}(s)\)</span>. There are two different ways that the covariance matrix is typically represented.</p>
<p><strong>The first way:</strong> There is a single vector of log standard deviations, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log \sigma\)</span>, which is <strong>not</strong> a function of state: the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log \sigma\)</span> are standalone parameters. (You Should Know: our implementations of VPG, TRPO, and PPO do it this way.)</p>
<p><strong>The second way:</strong> There is a neural network that maps from states to log standard deviations, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\log \sigma_{\theta}(s)\)</span>. It may optionally share some layers with the mean network.</p>
<p>Note that in both cases we output log standard deviations instead of standard deviations directly. This is because log stds are free to take on any values in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\((-\infty, \infty)\)</span>, while stds must be nonnegative. It’s easier to train parameters if you don’t have to enforce those kinds of constraints. The standard deviations can be obtained immediately from the log standard deviations by exponentiating them, so we do not lose anything by representing them this way.</p>
<p><strong>Sampling.</strong> Given the mean action <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu_{\theta}(s)\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma_{\theta}(s)\)</span>, and a vector <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z\)</span> of noise from a spherical Gaussian (<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(z \sim \mathcal{N}(0, I)\)</span>), an action sample can be computed with</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[a = \mu_{\theta}(s) + \sigma_{\theta}(s) \odot z,\]</div>
<p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\odot\)</span> denotes the elementwise product of two vectors. Standard frameworks have built-in ways to generate the noise vectors, such as <a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/torch.html#torch.normal">torch.normal</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/random/normal">tf.random_normal</a>. Alternatively, you can build distribution objects, eg through <a class="reference external" href="https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/distributions.html#normal">torch.distributions.Normal</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r1.15/api_docs/python/tf/distributions/Normal">tf.distributions.Normal</a>, and use them to generate samples. (The advantage of the latter approach is that those objects can also calculate log-likelihoods for you.)</p>
<p><strong>Log-Likelihood.</strong> The log-likelihood of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k\)</span> -dimensional action <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>, for a diagonal Gaussian with mean <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\mu = \mu_{\theta}(s)\)</span> and standard deviation <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\sigma = \sigma_{\theta}(s)\)</span>, is given by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\log \pi_{\theta}(a|s) = -\frac{1}{2}\left(\sum_{i=1}^k \left(\frac{(a_i - \mu_i)^2}{\sigma_i^2} + 2 \log \sigma_i \right) + k \log 2\pi \right).\]</div>

<h3>Trajectories<a class="headerlink" href="#trajectories" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>

\[\tau = (s_0, a_0, s_1, a_1, ...).\]</div>
<p>The very first state of the world, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s_0\)</span>, is randomly sampled from the <strong>start-state distribution</strong>, sometimes denoted by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_0\)</span>:</p>

<section id="reward-and-return">
<h3>Reward and Return<a class="headerlink" href="#reward-and-return" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The reward function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R\)</span> is critically important in reinforcement learning. It depends on the current state of the world, the action just taken, and the next state of the world:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[r_t = R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\]</div>
<p>although frequently this is simplified to just a dependence on the current state, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_t = R(s_t)\)</span>, or state-action pair <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_t = R(s_t,a_t)\)</span>.</p>
<p>The goal of the agent is to maximize some notion of cumulative reward over a trajectory, but this actually can mean a few things. We’ll notate all of these cases with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R(\tau)\)</span>, and it will either be clear from context which case we mean, or it won’t matter (because the same equations will apply to all cases).</p>
<p>One kind of return is the <strong>finite-horizon undiscounted return</strong>, which is just the sum of rewards obtained in a fixed window of steps:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[R(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^T r_t.\]</div>
<p>Another kind of return is the <strong>infinite-horizon discounted return</strong>, which is the sum of all rewards <em>ever</em> obtained by the agent, but discounted by how far off in the future they’re obtained. This formulation of reward includes a discount factor <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma \in (0,1)\)</span>:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[R(\tau) = \sum_{t=0}^{\infty} \gamma^t r_t.\]</div>
<p>Why would we ever want a discount factor, though? Don’t we just want to get <em>all</em> rewards? We do, but the discount factor is both intuitively appealing and mathematically convenient. On an intuitive level: cash now is better than cash later. Mathematically: an infinite-horizon sum of rewards <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_series">may not converge</a> to a finite value, and is hard to deal with in equations. But with a discount factor and under reasonable conditions, the infinite sum converges.</p>
<div class="admonition-you-should-know admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">You Should Know</p>
<p>While the line between these two formulations of return are quite stark in RL formalism, deep RL practice tends to blur the line a fair bit—for instance, we frequently set up algorithms to optimize the undiscounted return, but use discount factors in estimating <strong>value functions</strong>.</p>

<section id="the-rl-problem">
<h3>The RL Problem<a class="headerlink" href="#the-rl-problem" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Whatever the choice of return measure (whether infinite-horizon discounted, or finite-horizon undiscounted), and whatever the choice of policy, the goal in RL is to select a policy which maximizes <strong>expected return</strong> when the agent acts according to it.</p>
<p>To talk about expected return, we first have to talk about probability distributions over trajectories.</p>
<p>Let’s suppose that both the environment transitions and the policy are stochastic. In this case, the probability of a <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T\)</span> -step trajectory is:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[P(\tau|\pi) = \rho_0 (s_0) \prod_{t=0}^{T-1} P(s_{t+1} | s_t, a_t) \pi(a_t | s_t).\]</div>
<p>The expected return (for whichever measure), denoted by <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(J(\pi)\)</span>, is then:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[J(\pi) = \int_{\tau} P(\tau|\pi) R(\tau) = \underE{\tau\sim \pi}{R(\tau)}.\]</div>
<p>The central optimization problem in RL can then be expressed by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[\pi^* = \arg \max_{\pi} J(\pi),\]</div>
<p>with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi^*\)</span> being the <strong>optimal policy</strong>.</p>

<section id="value-functions">
<h3>Value Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#value-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It’s often useful to know the <strong>value</strong> of a state, or state-action pair. By value, we mean the expected return if you start in that state or state-action pair, and then act according to a particular policy forever after. <strong>Value functions</strong> are used, one way or another, in almost every RL algorithm.</p>
<p>There are four main functions of note here.</p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p>The <strong>On-Policy Value Function</strong>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(V^{\pi}(s)\)</span>, which gives the expected return if you start in state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and always act according to policy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span>:</p>

<p>When we talk about value functions, if we do not make reference to time-dependence, we only mean expected <strong>infinite-horizon discounted return</strong>. Value functions for finite-horizon undiscounted return would need to accept time as an argument. Can you think about why? Hint: what happens when time’s up?</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition-you-should-know admonition">
<p class="admonition-title">You Should Know</p>
<p>There are two key connections between the value function and the action-value function that come up pretty often:</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V^{\pi}(s) = \underE{a\sim \pi}{Q^{\pi}(s,a)},\]</div>
<p>and</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[V^*(s) = \max_a Q^* (s,a).\]</div>
<p>These relations follow pretty directly from the definitions just given: can you prove them?</p>

<h3>The Optimal Q-Function and the Optimal Action<a class="headerlink" href="#the-optimal-q-function-and-the-optimal-action" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There is an important connection between the optimal action-value function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q^*(s,a)\)</span> and the action selected by the optimal policy. By definition, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q^*(s,a)\)</span> gives the expected return for starting in state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>, taking (arbitrary) action <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>, and then acting according to the optimal policy forever after.</p>
<p>The optimal policy in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> will select whichever action maximizes the expected return from starting in <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>. As a result, if we have <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q^*\)</span>, we can directly obtain the optimal action, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a^*(s)\)</span>, via</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[a^*(s) = \arg \max_a Q^* (s,a).\]</div>
<p>Note: there may be multiple actions which maximize <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(Q^*(s,a)\)</span>, in which case, all of them are optimal, and the optimal policy may randomly select any of them. But there is always an optimal policy which deterministically selects an action.</p>

<h3>Bellman Equations<a class="headerlink" href="#bellman-equations" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All four of the value functions obey special self-consistency equations called <strong>Bellman equations</strong>. The basic idea behind the Bellman equations is this:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The value of your starting point is the reward you expect to get from being there, plus the value of wherever you land next.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The Bellman equations for the on-policy value functions are</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
V^{\pi}(s) &amp;= \underE{a \sim \pi \\ s'\sim P}{r(s,a) + \gamma V^{\pi}(s')}, \\
Q^{\pi}(s,a) &amp;= \underE{s'\sim P}{r(s,a) + \gamma \underE{a'\sim \pi}{Q^{\pi}(s',a')}},
\end{align*}</div><p>where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s' \sim P\)</span> is shorthand for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s' \sim P(\cdot |s,a)\)</span>, indicating that the next state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s'\)</span> is sampled from the environment’s transition rules; <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a \sim \pi\)</span> is shorthand for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a \sim \pi(\cdot|s)\)</span>; and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a' \sim \pi\)</span> is shorthand for <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a' \sim \pi(\cdot|s')\)</span>.</p>
<p>The Bellman equations for the optimal value functions are</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\begin{align*}
V^*(s) &amp;= \max_a \underE{s'\sim P}{r(s,a) + \gamma V^*(s')}, \\
Q^*(s,a) &amp;= \underE{s'\sim P}{r(s,a) + \gamma \max_{a'} Q^*(s',a')}.
\end{align*}</div><p>The crucial difference between the Bellman equations for the on-policy value functions and the optimal value functions, is the absence or presence of the <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\max\)</span> over actions. Its inclusion reflects the fact that whenever the agent gets to choose its action, in order to act optimally, it has to pick whichever action leads to the highest value.</p>

<p>The term “Bellman backup” comes up quite frequently in the RL literature. The Bellman backup for a state, or state-action pair, is the right-hand side of the Bellman equation: the reward-plus-next-value.</p>

<section id="advantage-functions">
<h3>Advantage Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#advantage-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes in RL, we don’t need to describe how good an action is in an absolute sense, but only how much better it is than others on average. That is to say, we want to know the relative <strong>advantage</strong> of that action. We make this concept precise with the <strong>advantage function.</strong></p>
<p>The advantage function <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A^{\pi}(s,a)\)</span> corresponding to a policy <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span> describes how much better it is to take a specific action <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span> in state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span>, over randomly selecting an action according to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi(\cdot|s)\)</span>, assuming you act according to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\pi\)</span> forever after. Mathematically, the advantage function is defined by</p>
<div class="math notranslate nohighlight">
\[A^{\pi}(s,a) = Q^{\pi}(s,a) - V^{\pi}(s).\]</div>
<div class="admonition-you-should-know admonition">

<p>We’ll discuss this more later, but the advantage function is crucially important to policy gradient methods.</p>

<h2><a class="toc-backref" href="#id5">(Optional) Formalism</a><a class="headerlink" href="#optional-formalism" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>So far, we’ve discussed the agent’s environment in an informal way, but if you try to go digging through the literature, you’re likely to run into the standard mathematical formalism for this setting: <strong>Markov Decision Processes</strong> (MDPs). An MDP is a 5-tuple, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\langle S, A, R, P, \rho_0 \rangle\)</span>, where</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(S\)</span> is the set of all valid states,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(A\)</span> is the set of all valid actions,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(R : S \times A \times S \to \mathbb{R}\)</span> is the reward function, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_t = R(s_t, a_t, s_{t+1})\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P : S \times A \to \mathcal{P}(S)\)</span> is the transition probability function, with <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P(s'|s,a)\)</span> being the probability of transitioning into state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s'\)</span> if you start in state <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(s\)</span> and take action <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(a\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p>and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\rho_0\)</span> is the starting state distribution.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The name Markov Decision Process refers to the fact that the system obeys the <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_property">Markov property</a>: transitions only depend on the most recent state and action, and no prior history.</p>
