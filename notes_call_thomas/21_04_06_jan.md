# Call with more details
## Output
- Fast RL environment with parallel training
- Use custom torch model
- train with 10-50 agents
- put environment logic in linear algebra to use torch fast computations
- use dummy dimensions to get math right

## Thomas will send
- linalg physics paper with lucas and nino
- ipynb with code examples

## Techniques
- use hirarchical model
- try RNN

## Regarding continuous and discrete spaces
- people think in discrete spaces
- some think tahts easier to train
- he prefers continous spaces
- FOR NOW: start with discrete spaces

## Tech
- See ipynb created during call
- checkout tianshou

## Problem with current environemnt
- slow training
- RNN agents didnt work
- bad scaling behaviour
- only works with very few agents
- sequential processing of agent agents (implement async)
- only got dqn to work and therefore only on discrete spaces
